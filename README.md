Motivation
A large number of projects have almost no or inadequate documentation. When we want to expand or contribute to the project in any way, it is useful if you can quickly navigate its structure. The simplest solution is to draw a dependency graph between modules (Python) or header files (C++), e.g. using GraphViz (SVG, PNG). Graph nodes represent modules and arrows of dependencies between them.
